    In 2007, Janet Skinner would plead guilty to false accounting and be sentenced to 9 months in jail.
Janet had joined the Post Office in 1994, and due to her exemplary skill, would quickly rise to the
role of a post mistress in Hull. She had no problems with her work, until the Horizon system was
installed. The Horizon system was a software so the post office could link all its tills together, but it
had some major bugs. Now, Janet Skinner’s totals were not adding up and her shortfalls had quickly
risen to £59,000. She called investigators to help her work out where the money had gone, but in an
unfortunate turn of events, she lost her shop and simply had to hope that pleading guilty to a crime
she never committed would keep her out of jail. Ms Skinner stated, “I remember standing in the
dock and the judge saying I was untrustworthy and stealing from pensioners”. The Post Office forced
Ms Skinner to pay £11,000 as compensation. Fast-forward to 2021, and the courts have finally found
her innocent, but she is still to be fully compensated.
</p> <br>

<p>
    Ms Skinner’s story is just one out of the 980 people who have been found guilty of false accounting
because of the failures of this system. Sadly, it would cause many to have to remortgage their
houses and many found themselves drowning in a sea of debt, as those who did not have tens of
thousands of pounds lying around would face private prosecution in which the Post Office would
investigate cases, not the police. Many of these people would become vilified by their communities.
The lucky ones would have the community help them, such as Jo Hamilton in Hampshire, in which
the community raised £9,000, to help with her £36,000 of debt. The unlucky were physically abused
and would be shunned- some were even spat on by members of their community. Even the children
of the falsely accused would be bullied for what their parents did not actually do. Sadly, of the 980
postmasters and sub postmasters accused of false accounting over the period of the allegations only
93 of the cases have been overturned by the courts and have had their names cleared of
wrongdoing.
</p> <br>

<p>
    So far, the Post Office has given “Well over £1 million”- according to Professor Chris Hodgens, chair
of the Horizon independent review board, however for many, lives to fallen apart, marriages
collapsed, and the families of victims say that it has left them with health conditions such as
depression, addiction and tragically, lives were cut short. So, although one million may sound like a
lot, many of these people are unfairly still classed as criminals, and after having their livelihoods
destroyed, the money is the least they can receive.
</p> <br>

<p>
    The Horizon system was and is still in service (although it has received numerous updates and is
described to be at its most “robust” by the Post Office). The Horizon system was implemented to be
easier than handling paper receipts, however its numeracy problems and hundreds of bugs would
cause the system to cause 980 people to have their systems appear with gigantic shortfalls, all of
which they had to pay back in full under contract. The company in charge of the Horizon system,
Fujitsu, continue to be given large government contracts to this day.
</p> <br>

<p>
    The Post Office would spend £38 million on lawyers to defend the system, according to computer
weekly, one of the first papers to call out the scandal: “The Post Office also sent people to prison to
make an example of them. Former sub postmaster Seema Misra was prosecuted and sent to prison
based on evidence from the Horizon system. After she was convicted, former Post Office head of
criminal law Jarnail Singh wrote a celebratory email to colleagues, claiming this result would stop
others from “jumping on the Horizon bashing bandwagon”.” They would also have the call centres
tell people they were alone in having issues, even if this was not true. In 2021, the ex-boss of the
Post Office would quit her job, citing her failing in the scandal.
</p> <br>

<p>
    In 2003, one sub postmaster from Lancashire blamed horizon for their shortfall issues, would call in
an independent IT specialist to help in their case against the Post Office, for the IT specialist to point
out several problems with the Horizon software. The Post Office knew that if this case got out it
would show other post masters and postmistresses that they were not alone in having problems,
and so the post office would pay of the sub postmaster and force them to sign a non-disclosure
agreement so they could continue their campaign of civil and legal cases to chase up shortfalls.
</p> <br>

<p>
    However, the story would start to unravel, and justice would begin with a man known as Alan Bates.
Mr Bates would write into computer weekly, as he was a victim of the Horizon. Mr Bates lost his job,
in his Post Office in Wales and his life savings. Yet despite being crippled by this, he would spread
the word to people in the Post Office that they were not the only people suffering problems with the system.

    ABOVE: Mr Bates letter to computer weekly.
Recently, the story has been turned into a documentary by ITV, in which it made light of the human impact on the post masters and mistresses and shows their road to justice. But this also raised the attention to the case and has vastly increased the public knowledge and has led for calls for justice for those accused and has increased the public pressure for the names to be cleared.

</p> <br>

<p>
    Now, a plan by the government to put through that would reverse the sentences of all those whom the Post Office would have found guilty of fraud, theft and false accounting is being considered. It is hoped that this legislation will be able to clear the names of all who have been forced to plead guilty by the Post Office, and so it is hoped that justice may finally come for those who have been dragged through twenty years of utter hell, still being called criminals for a crime they never committed. It is hoped the public pressure will force the government to implement laws to clear the postmasters and sub postmasters of wrongdoing.
