        In match-day 2 of the Champions League, there were some predictable scores and some unpredictable ones. We'll start with the unpredictable ones. PSG was taken to the toon by Newcastle, losing 4-1 in a match many expected PSG to win easily. There was also a meltdown at Old Trafford as Manchester United lost to Galatasaray 3-2, putting Erik ten Hag in a very difficult situation. In France, Arsenal lost 2-1 to Lens in a disappointing game for the Gunners, who were looking to go top of the group with six points. To finish up for the English teams, Manchester City beat RB Leipzig 3-1 at the City of Manchester Stadium to stay on top of the group.

        Regarding the group leaders, Bayern Munich sits at the top of their group after a narrow 2-1 win over Copenhagen, but due to Manchester United's loss, they remain on top. Union Berlin had another close match that they lost by one goal, this time against Braga. To round out the Germans, Borussia Dortmund, which, fun fact, translates to Prussian Dortmund, drew 0-0 against AC Milan.

Barcelona beat Porto 1-0 despite having 10 men, and Atletico Madrid remains at the top of their group after beating Feyenoord 3-2. Saliva drew 2-2 with the Dutch side PSV.
