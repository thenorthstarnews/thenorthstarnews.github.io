    <p> Quantum Computing is a relatively new branch of science that combines elements of
        classical computing and quantum physics in order to create superpowered computers.
        Normal computers use bits to store data in the form of ones and zeros known as binary,
        however quantum computers use qubits to store data. Qubits are quantum particles that are
        in a constant state of superposition meaning that they are both ones and zeros at the same
        time. A very small number of qubits can complete difficult tasks insanely quickly compared to
        classic computers with billions of bits. Now how exactly do these superpowered quantum
        computers pose a risk to our online privacy and security? </p> <br>

        <p>
            In order to keep our data private while sending it across the web, your computer will
automatically encrypt it by changing your message into an unreadable combination of
random numbers, letters and symbols which can only be decrypted by the intended users
device. This encryption is generated using maths – taking two fairly large prime numbers
and multiplying them together to create and even larger number. It is then decrypted by
finding out the initial factors that were used to multiply the huge number in the first place.
The intended users device can do this very easily as they are given the ‘key’ to find out
these numbers however to someone without said key, even using powerful algorithms it
would take hundreds of years to calculate the numbers and decode the message. This is
when quantum computers come in, due to using qubits they can pretty much complete
hundreds of tasks all at once making it very easy for them to quickly break encryption and
steal information. If malicious hackers are able to utilise quantum computers then entire
governments could be at risk of having secret information stolen and sold to different
organizations. Clearly this is a huge concern as more quantum computers are being
developed and therefore top mathematicians have been tasked with developing new
methods of encryption that not even the most powerful computer would be able to break.
        </p> <br>

        <p>
            In 2016, the national institute of standards and technology (NIST) launched a competition to
find a new way to encrypt data that not even quantum computers could break. They ended
up with 82 different possible solutions, the most highly thought of being to do with vectors.
Image you have a piece of paper with several evenly spaced black dots on it and you can
only draw straight lines in specific directions in order to connect to other dots – this is
essentially a vector as shown below:

        <p>
            Finding pathways to specific dots on a 2-d grid is fairly simple to do, even with complicated
            direction vectors ie. Not just 1 left, 2 up for example. However as you increase the number of
            dimensions of the grid this becomes more and more difficult to the point that even a quantum
            computer would struggle (hundreds or even thousands of dimensions). This will be the new
            version of encryption with only the intended user having the instructions to work out the
            necessary vectors and decode the message again, preventing hackers from intercepting and
            stealing important data. So even with superpowered, decrypting quantum computers our
            online data should hopefully continue to stay safe and secure. Well that is until our
            technology inevitably advances once again, but we can leave future us to worry about
            that….
