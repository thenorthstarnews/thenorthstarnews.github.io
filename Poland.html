    On the 15 th of October, the far-right, Law and Justice party finally lost to a tidal wave of young people
    dreaming of change. The Law and order party who have been in charge for 8 years, have been
    hellbent on removing the rights of women, especially rights to abortions, and the removal of rights
    from the LGBTQ+ population who have been beaten by the more centralist political parties whom have
    agreed to create a coalition to not allow the Law and order party to regain power.
</p> <br>

<p>
    The Law and Justice party (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość) or the PiS have controlled Poland for 8 years,
    where they have actively repressed the rights of the LGBTQ+. During the 2020 successful election
    campaign, they pledged they would ban teaching about LGBT issues in schools and they proposed
    changing the constitution to ban LGBT couples from adopting children. The PiS have also stopped
    pride parades from being allowed to go ahead. The party has strong links to right wing Christianity,
    which has guided policies such as a ban on abortions and the removal of sexual education programs
    in schools. Here in Scotland, we have a similar party, the infamous Scottish family party who have
    many similar policies and have in turn faded into the shadows of politics.
</p> <br>

    Although Poland was one of the earlier countries in Europe to give full women's suffrage, its long
and unstable history, having been occupied by both the Nazis and the Soviets have caused a major
backwards turn for women rights. The communist takeover has majorly set back women and
minority rights in Poland and wider ex-soviet republics. The movement which was meant to unite
the Proletariat (The term coined by Karl Marks to describe the working people) ended up removing
legal limitations in marriages in the Soviet Union, however the attitudes towards women hardly
shifted with women role primarily in domestic duties not shifting in this time, the Soviet agenda can
also be seen in its LGBTQ+ politics where in the Soviet Union, being gay could land you in the gulag
for 5 years. The Polish population is 87.6% Christian, meaning that so called Christian values are
widespread (although most Christians would not stand in opposition, the religious right wing is a
problem in Poland), leading to difficulties with the LGBTQ and women's rights.

<p>
    The PiS are also very pro-Russian, and like the Russian friends, not so keen on democracy. The party
    has been described by many as authoritarian, making the election a battle between a democratic
    and authoritarian government. The PiS have torn apart the Justice system and removed any sense of
    fairness, going as far as to have these elections being the only partially fair elections in a decade. The
    PiS have been a supporter of Moscow during the Invasion of Ukraine and have used their
    propaganda machine to further Putin's cause. Although the Tusk coalition will have difficulties
    reintroducing democracy and rights to minority groups. “This is the end of grim times,” Tusk
    declared after their victory.
</p> <br>

<p>
    The leader of the new government is ready to steer the government towards becoming a modern
    European country. “Abortion is a woman’s decision, not a priest’s, prosecutor’s, policeman’s or party
    activists.” was a statement by Donald Tusk, the new leader of Poland. Donald Tusk has also promised
    to legalise same sex partnerships in Poland, a gigantic leap in the rights of Poland's LGBTQ+ rights.
    This kind of change will be immensely helpful in the fight against discrimination and be the first
    proper legal rights. Aswell as these changes, he has also pledged his allegiance to Kyiv, ready to
    stand shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the European nations in Russia’s war of aggression
    against Ukraine.

<p>
    Now I can see the question in all your minds, what does this election 1400 miles away affect me?
    This election is important for everyone, not only does it show that the right wing can be beaten, but
    it shows the power of the youth, the students today become the adults of tomorrow. Having a voice
    now matters, change is possible, and throughout history it has been the students who have guided
    society forward, from the US civil rights movement to the elections in Poland. Both were led by
    students and have made great positive change, so use your voice for good. Choose a movement and
    help because you and your opinion matter, and you can make a significant difference in this world.
